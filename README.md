# WarmHome

WarmHome is your platform to find & list houses for sale or for rent.<br />
It's a hands-on React with Firebase v9 project I developed while self-learning the course [React Front To Back 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-front-to-back-2022/) by Brad Traversy on Udemy.<br /><br />

- Sign in using your email or via Google OAuth.
- List your house and give it an offer or discount.
- Upload photos of the property - it'll be saved to Firebase storage.
- Explore other listings, offers & discounts.




## Usage

The listings use positionstack.com Geocoding REST API to get the coords (latitude and longitude) from the address field.
